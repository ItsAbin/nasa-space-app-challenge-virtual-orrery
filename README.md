# NASA Space Apps Challenge - Virtual Orrery Project 🌌

Welcome to the Virtual Orrery project, developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, a global hackathon that encourages participants to create innovative solutions using NASA's open data. This project is an interactive simulation that visualizes planetary orbits and tracks the positions of celestial bodies in real-time. The Virtual Orrery offers users a chance to explore and learn more about the dynamics of the solar system and astronomy.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Our Virtual Orrery provides an educational and immersive experience by allowing users to:
- Simulate Celestial Movements: Observe the real-time movement of planets and near-Earth objects.
- Explore Planetary Orbits: Navigate through the solar system and understand the paths of planets around the Sun.
- Gain Insights into Astronomy: Learn how planetary alignments and near-Earth asteroids behave using actual NASA data.

The project was collaboratively developed by a team of space enthusiasts as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge, leveraging NASA’s open datasets to provide accurate and up-to-date astronomical information.

### 📈 How It Works

NASA Open Data: The orrery utilizes real-time NASA open data, providing precise orbital mechanics for planets and near-Earth objects.

3D Rendering: We use modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries to create an immersive 3D environment that renders celestial objects and tracks their movements.

User Interaction: Navigate through the solar system using an intuitive control panel, zoom in on specific planets, and view postions of near-Earth objects.
