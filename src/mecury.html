          Mercury is the closest to the Sun and smallest planet in our solar system. Mercury surface is rocky, cratered,
          like our Moon, but much, much smaller. Mercury nearly has no atmosphere and thus hardly any heat trapping.
          Temperature near Mercury varies enormously from scorching hot during the day to freezing cold at night time:
          -180°C or -290°F. The speediest planet, in fact, is Mercury, which does not have a moon and orbits the sun in
          only 88 days on Earth. Mercury&#39;s surface, too, is composed of heavily cratered terrain with little weather
          or geological activity.<br />Size: 4,880 km (smallest planet)<br />Mass: 5.5% of Earth&#39;s mass<br />Distance
          from the Sun: 58 million km<br />Atmosphere: Very thin, mainly oxygen, sodium, and small amounts of hydrogen
          and helium
