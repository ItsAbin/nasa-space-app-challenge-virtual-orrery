          Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth&#39;s &#34;sister planet&#34; due to its
          similar size and composition. However, its atmosphere is vastly different, with thick clouds of sulfuric acid
          and a dense carbon dioxide layer that causes extreme greenhouse effects. Venus has surface temperatures hot
          enough to melt lead, reaching around 465°C (869°F). It rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction to
          most planets, with one day on Venus lasting longer than its year. The planet has no moons and is known for
          being the brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon.<br />Size (Diameter): 12,104 km (a little
          smaller than Earth)<br />Mass: 81.5% of Earth’s mass<br />Distance from the Sun: 108 million km (or 67 million
          miles)<br />Atmosphere: Mostly carbon dioxide (96.5%) and some nitrogen (3.5%), with clouds of sulfuric acid.
