          The central star of our solar system is the Sun, which supports warmness and light to make life on Earth. It
          is basically composed of hydrogen about 74% and helium about 24%. Its surface temperature is approximately
          5,500°C or 9,932°F and that of the core reaches approximately 15 million degrees centigrade or 27 million
          degrees Fahrenheit. The Sun functions as an energy-generating star through nuclear fusion; it changes hydrogen
          into helium. The Sun is 1.39 million km or 864,000 miles in diameter and about 109 times in diameter compared
          to Earth. <br />Size (Diameter): Approximately 1.39 million km (864,000 miles)<br />Mass: About 1.99×10301.99
