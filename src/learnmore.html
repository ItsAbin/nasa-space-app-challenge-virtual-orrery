    <h1><u>VIRTUAL-ORRERY</u></h1>
    <p>A digital orrery is an advanced computer simulation model that shows the rising positions of celestial bodies, for example, planets, moons, asteroids, and in some cases even comets, as they move around a central star, usually the Sun. Whereas the traditional mechanical orreries were generally complex and gear-driven models limited to a few celestial bodies, virtual orreries now have the capability to model complicated astronomical systems with very high precision and detail. These simulations not only permit users to observe and manipulate celestial bodies in real-time but also to fast-forward and rewind to see planetary alignments and specific astronomical occurrences over many time periods, past and future. Later models allow users to interact with it by zooming in on specific celestial bodies, changing the perspective to represent the solar system from different directions, or even tracking the trajectories of asteroids and other celestial events which the physical models did not realistically replicate. By providing a realistic overview of the celestial mechanics both for the students and for the interested amateurs, as well as scientists and researchers, they supply a way to understand celestial motions without the physical constraints and scale limitations imposed by traditional orreries. Time scales with adjustable accuracy, real-time correct data integration, and the possibility to simulate hypothetical orbits or events are some of the functions that make virtual orreries a very powerful tool for studying and understanding the cosmos.
