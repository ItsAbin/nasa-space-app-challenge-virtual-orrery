            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse surface,
            including oceans, mountains, forests, and deserts. Earth’s atmosphere is rich in nitrogen (78%) and oxygen
            (21%), which helps regulate temperature and protects life from harmful solar radiation. It has a moderate
            climate, with liquid water covering about 71% of its surface. Earth orbits the Sun every 365.25 days and has
            one moon. Its balanced conditions make it a perfect habitat for a wide variety of plants, animals, and
            humans.
