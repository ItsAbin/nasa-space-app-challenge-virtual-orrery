          Mars, often referred to as the &#34;Red Planet,&#34; is the fourth planet from the Sun in our <br> solar system. It
          has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with <br> traces of nitrogen and argon. Mars is about
          half the size of Earth, with a diameter <br>of approximately 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles). Its surface is rocky,
          with mountains, <br> valleys, and large dust storms that can last for months.<br /><br />Here are some notable
          features of Mars:<br />Color: The reddish appearance comes from iron oxide, or rust, on its surface.<br />Moons:
          Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, thought to be captured <br>asteroids.<br />Surface: It has the
          largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a vast <br> canyon system, Valles Marineris.<br />Water:
          While liquid water can't exist for long on the surface today, there is evidence <br>that Mars once had flowing
          rivers and lakes, and water ice has been found beneath <br> the surface.<br />Temperature: Mars is much colder than
          Earth, with an average surface temperature <br> of about -80°F (-60°C), though it can range from a warm 70°F (20°C)
          during the day <br> near the equator to -195°F (-125°C) at night.
