            The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust. At its center is the
            Sun, a star that provides heat and light. It holds 99.86% of the solar system’s total mass, with its strong
            gravitational pull keeping all the planets and other celestial bodies in orbit.<br />The eight planets can
            be divided into two groups:<br />Terrestrial Planets (Inner Planets):<br />These are the four rocky planets
            closest to the Sun – Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They have solid surfaces, relatively small sizes, and
            few or no moons.<br />Gas and Ice Giants (Outer Planets):<br />The outer planets, Jupiter and Saturn (gas
            giants) and Uranus and Neptune (ice giants), are much larger and are composed mostly of hydrogen, helium,
            and other gases or ices. They have ring systems and many moons.<br />Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt, a
            region filled with icy objects, including dwarf planets like Pluto and Eris. Even farther out is the Oort
            Cloud, a spherical shell of icy debris thought to be the source of long-period comets.

            The solar system consists of the Sun and all the celestial bodies that orbit it, including eight planets,
            their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets. The planets, in order of their distance from the Sun, are
            Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The Sun’s gravity keeps these objects in
            orbit.
